# Online Shopping Store

In this project, we were supposed to design a simple online-shopping store developing in `Java`. The project contains two main parts:
1. The depot app 
2. The customer app.

There is a connection between the depot and the store apps in a way that they can update to the newest information. We used `TCP` (Transmission Control Protocol) to fulfill this need.

One of the main properties of this system is the number of users who can be connected to the server simultaneously; by applying `Multi-threading`, there is no limit on this number!

This project is done semester-2 midterm project. To do this, we (Mobina Pooladi and Ibehzad shomali) used `JavaFX` combined with `CSS` to design the front-end, and also the logic of the program is developed in Java.

You can also find a demo video of how this sytem works [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxPTDi6WB8nzlASSmDcQWsrWsDamvcZg/view?usp=sharing)!
